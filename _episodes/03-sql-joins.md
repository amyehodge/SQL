## Joins

To combine data from two tables we use the SQL `JOIN` command, which comes after
the `FROM` command.

We will also need to use the keyword `ON` to tell the computer which columns provide the link ([Primary Key > Foreign Key](#design)) between the two tables. In this case, the species_id column in the **species** table is defined as the primary key. It contains the same data as the **survey** table's species_id column, which is the foreign key in this case. We want to join the tables on these species_id fields.

    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    JOIN species
    ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;

`ON` is like `WHERE`, it filters things out according to a test condition. We use
the `table.colname` format to tell the manager what column in which table we are
referring to.

Field names that are identical in both tables can confuse the software so you must specify which table you are talking about, any time you mention these fields. You do this by inserting the table name in front of the field name as `table.colname`, as I have done above in the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` parts of the query.

We often won't want all of the fields from both tables, so anywhere we would
have used a field name in a non-join query, we can use `table.colname`.

For example, what if we wanted information on when individuals of each
species were captured, but instead of their species ID we wanted their
actual species names.

    SELECT surveys.year, surveys.month, surveys.day, species.genus, species.species
    FROM surveys
    JOIN species
    ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;

### Different join types

We can count the number of records returned by our original join query.

    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM surveys
    JOIN species
    USING (species_id);

Notice that this number is smaller than the number of records present in the
survey data.

This is because, by default, SQL only returns records where the joining value
is present in the joined columns of both tables (i.e. it takes the _intersection_
of the two join columns). This joining behavior is known as an `INNER JOIN`.
In fact the `JOIN` command is simply shorthand for `INNER JOIN` and the two
terms can be used interchangably as they will produce the same result.

We can also tell the computer that we wish to keep all the records in the first
table by using the command `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, or `LEFT JOIN` for short.

### Combining joins with sorting and aggregation

Joins can be combined with sorting, filtering, and aggregation. So, if we
wanted average mass of the individuals on each different type of treatment, we
could do something like

    SELECT plots.plot_type, AVG(surveys.weight)
    FROM surveys
    JOIN plots
    ON surveys.plot_id = plots.plot_id
    GROUP BY plots.plot_type;

> ## Challenge:

> - How many animals of each genus were caught in each plot? Report the answer with the greatest number at the top of the list.

> > FROM surveys
> > JOIN species
> > ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id
> > GROUP BY species.genus, surveys.plot_id
> > ORDER BY number_indiv DESC;
> > ~~~
> > {: .sql}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

You can also combine many tables using a `JOIN`. The query must include enough `JOIN`...`ON` clauses to link all of the tables together. In the query below, we are now looking at the count of each species for each type of plot during each year. This required 1) adding in an extra `JOIN`...`ON` clause, 2) including plot_type in the `SELECT` portion of the statement, and 3) adding plot_type to the `GROUP BY` function:

    SELECT surveys.species_id, surveys.year, plots.plot_type, COUNT(*), AVG(surveys.weight)
    FROM surveys
    JOIN species ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id
    JOIN plots ON plots.plot_id = surveys.plot_id
    GROUP BY surveys.species_id, surveys.year, plots.plot_type
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
    
To practice we have some optional challenges for you.

## <a name="command"></a> Running sqlite3 from the command line

The SQLite Manager plug in we have been using for this lesson is a convenient interface for working with a database. However, you might want to store and edit queries in a file, or be able to automatically direct your output to a file. These are tasks are much simpler when run from the command line.

SQLite3 can be run directly from the command line. Detailed information about how to do this is available at [sqlite.org](http://sqlite.org/cli.html).

In order to do this you need to be in the shell (Terminal window on Mac), and you need to be in the directory where your .sqlite database file resides. Then type `sqlite3` followed by the name of the .sqlite databases file and you are instantly in the sql interface, ready to type in a query.

* Type `.help` at the prompt to see options available, or check out the more detailed explanation of most of your choices at the sqlite.org link above.   
* Type `.tables` to see a list of all your database tables.    
* Type any `SELECT` statement directly from the prompt. Be sure to end with a semicolon. That's how the computer knows you are at the end of the query. Hit `Enter` or `Return` after the semicolon to run the query.  
* Run a query from a .sql file (your query saved as a text document with a .sql file extension) by typing `.read` followed by a space and the file name.  
* Type `.mode csv` to change the standard output to .csv format (instead of delimited by pipes).    
* Type `.once` followed by a space and a file name to send the output from the next `.read` query to a file instead of to the screen.  
* Type `.exit` to leave sqlite.
