keypoints:
- "Use the `GROUP BY` keyword to aggregate data."
- "Functions like `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVERAGE`, `SUM`, `COUNT`, etc. operate on aggregated data."

## COUNT and GROUP BY

Aggregation allows us to combine results by grouping records based on value, also it is useful for
calculating combined values in groups.

Let’s go to the surveys table and find out how many individuals there are.
Using the wildcard * simply counts the number of records (rows):

    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM surveys;

There are many other aggregate functions included in SQL including `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `AVG`. We can find out the average of weight for all of those individuals by using the function `AVG`.

    SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(weight)
    FROM surveys;

Something a little more useful might be finding the number and average weight of a particular species in our survey, like DM.

	SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(weight)
    FROM surveys
    WHERE species_id="DM";

Now, let's see how many individuals were counted in each species. We do this
using a `GROUP BY` clause

    SELECT species_id, COUNT(*)
    FROM surveys
    GROUP BY species_id;

`GROUP BY` tells SQL what field or fields we want to use to aggregate the data.
If we want to group by multiple fields, we give `GROUP BY` a comma separated list.

## Ordering Aggregated Results

We can order the results of our aggregation by a specific column, including
the aggregated column. Let’s count the number of individuals of each
species captured, ordered by the count, then by species_id:

    SELECT species_id, COUNT(*)
    FROM surveys
    GROUP BY species_id
    ORDER BY COUNT(*), species_id;

## Aliases

As queries get more complex names can get long and unwieldy. To help make things
clearer we can use aliases to assign new names to things in the query.

We can use aliases in column names or table names using `AS`:

    SELECT MAX(year) AS last_surveyed_year
    FROM surveys;

The `AS` isn't technically required, so you could do

    SELECT MAX(year) last_surveyed_year
    FROM surveys;

but using `AS` is much clearer so it is good style to include it.

## The `HAVING` keyword

In the previous episode, we have seen the keyword `WHERE`, allowing to
filter the results according to some criteria. SQL offers a mechanism to
filter the results based on **aggregate functions**, through the `HAVING` keyword.

For example, we can request to only return information
about species with a count higher than 10:

    SELECT species_id, COUNT(species_id)
    FROM surveys
    GROUP BY species_id
    HAVING COUNT(species_id) > 10;

The `HAVING` keyword works exactly like the `WHERE` keyword, but uses
aggregate functions instead of database fields to filter.

If you use `AS` in your query to rename a column, `HAVING` you can use this
information to make the query more readable. For example, in the above
query, we can call the `COUNT(species_id)` by another name, like
`occurrences`. This can be written this way:

    SELECT species_id, COUNT(species_id) AS occurrences
    FROM surveys
    GROUP BY species_id
    HAVING occurrences > 10;

Note that in both queries, `HAVING` comes *after* `GROUP BY`. One way to
think about this is: the data are retrieved (`SELECT`), which can be filtered
(`WHERE`), then joined in groups (`GROUP BY`); finally, we can filter again based on some
of these groups (`HAVING`).
